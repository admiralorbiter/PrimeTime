# Product Vision & Scope

## Vision
A plug-and-play **live hype-loop** app for the PREP-KC Math Relays: seamlessly mix music, videos, photos, math-themed visuals, and big text with zero dead air. One operator controls prebuilt sequences and can react live with cues and a countdown.

## In-Scope (this iteration)
- Play **music** (inside the app) and **videos** (MP4).
- **Photo slideshow** with Ken-Burns and crossfades.
- **Math visuals** (GPU-friendly, parameterized presets).
- **Text cards** (slogans, school roll-call, sponsor thanks).
- **Countdown** (10→0, with stinger/confetti at 0).
- **Timeline editor** (build your show), **live cues** (countdown, confetti, blackout).
- Single-operator, single-machine, offline-first.

## Out-of-Scope (future)
- Multi-user uploads/moderation, advanced audio ducking/NDI/DMX, external scoreboard sync, beat-grid analysis (planned later).

## Success Criteria
- 20-minute 1080p loop runs smoothly with minimal operator input.
- New photos appear in the running slideshow within ~10 seconds.
- Countdown is accurate to the second and visually dominant.
