# Roadmap & Phased Plan

## Overview
Phase 1 follows a rendering-first approach, starting with math visualizations to establish the core engine, then layering music, text, photos, and video. Each phase is a vertical slice delivering independently testable functionality with UI controls, error handling, and acceptance tests.

## Development Order Rationale
1. **Math Visuals First** - Proves Canvas/WebGL rendering without asset dependencies
2. **Music Next** - Adds audio layer, independent of complex media
3. **Text Cards** - Simple Canvas rendering with animations
4. **Photos** - Introduces asset pipeline incrementally
5. **Video Last** - Most complex, builds on all previous work

## Phase 1A: Lean Foundation

**Goal**: Minimal infrastructure to support real-time rendering and operator control.

### Deliverables
1. **Flask server scaffold** - `/show` and `/operator` routes, static serving
2. **Minimal SQLite schema** - settings table only (defer asset tables)
3. **WebSocket plumbing** - SocketIO namespaces (`/control`, `/show`)
4. **Show View shell** - Canvas element, FPS counter, SocketIO connection
5. **Operator UI shell** - Connection status indicator, simple cue button

### What's Deferred
- Asset watcher and file system monitoring
- Complex database schema (assets, timelines, thumbnails)
- Asset validation and preprocessing
- Timeline editor

### Acceptance Criteria
- Two browser windows connect to server successfully
- FPS counter displays in Show View (even if just empty canvas)
- Operator UI sends ping, Show View responds with pong via WebSocket
- Connection status updates in real-time (connected/disconnected)

## Phase 1B: Math Visuals Core (First Vertical Slice) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: First math preset rendering at 60fps with live parameter control.

### Deliverables
1. **Rendering engine choice** ✅ - Canvas 2D API implemented (`static/show/utils/renderer.js`)
2. **Lissajous curves preset** ✅ - Parametric curve rendering with trail effect (`static/show/scenes/Lissajous.js`)
3. **Scene lifecycle** ✅ - Start, render loop, stop, cleanup (`static/show/utils/scene-manager.js`, `MathVisuals.js`)
4. **Operator UI controls** ✅ - "Start Lissajous" button, parameter sliders with debouncing (`static/operator/components/scene-controls.js`)
5. **WebSocket events** ✅ - `SHOW_START_SCENE`, `SHOW_UPDATE_PARAMS`, `SHOW_STOP_SCENE` fully implemented
6. **Performance monitoring** ✅ - FPS calculation and display in operator UI (`static/show/utils/renderer.js`)
7. **Error handling** ✅ - Canvas initialization failures, graceful degradation with user feedback

### Testing
- ✅ Unit test: Lissajous parameter validation (`tests/unit/test_lissajous_params.py`)
- ✅ Integration test: WebSocket event flow (`tests/integration/test_websocket_scene_control.py`)
- ✅ Performance test: FPS monitoring (`tests/integration/test_performance.py`)
- ✅ Manual test checklist: FPS sustains 60fps for 60 seconds (`tests/MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`)

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Lissajous curves render smoothly at 60fps (validated via FPS counter)
- ✅ Parameter sliders update visualization in real-time with debouncing
- ⏳ No memory leaks during 5-minute continuous run (requires manual testing)
- ✅ FPS reported to operator UI every second (implemented and tested)

### Implementation Notes
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for canvas initialization failures, context loss, and scene errors

- **UI Feedback**: Added toast notifications, loading states, and parameter update indicators
- **Performance**: FPS tracking implemented with 60-frame rolling average
- **Testing**: Unit tests for parameter validation, integration tests for WebSocket flow, manual test checklist for performance validation

## Notes on Vertical Slices

Each phase delivers:
- **Core functionality** working end-to-end
- **Operator UI** to control the feature
- **Error handling** and validation
- **Tests** (unit + integration at minimum)
- **Documentation** updates as we go

This approach allows for:
- Early demo-ability (show progress after each phase)
- Risk mitigation (prove hardest parts early)
- Flexibility (reprioritize phases based on feedback)
- Incremental complexity (build on solid foundation)
